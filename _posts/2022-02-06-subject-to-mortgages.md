title: Subject-to Mortgages
---
<p>Subject-to mortgages, also known as "subject-to" deals or "subject-to" transactions, are a type of real estate financing arrangement that allow buyers to take over the existing mortgage payments of a property owner. In other words, the buyer purchases the property "subject to" the existing mortgage, which remains in the name of the original owner.</p>

<p>This type of arrangement can be beneficial for both the buyer and the seller. For the buyer, it can allow for more flexible financing options, especially if they are unable to qualify for a traditional mortgage. Subject-to mortgages can also be a good option for investors looking to acquire properties without having to go through the lengthy and often complicated process of obtaining a new mortgage.</p>

<p>For the seller, a subject-to mortgage can be a way to sell a property quickly without having to pay off the existing mortgage in full. It can also be a way to transfer a mortgage to a new owner without triggering a due-on-sale clause, which would require the full repayment of the mortgage upon transfer of ownership.</p>

<p>However, subject-to mortgages can also come with risks for both parties. For the buyer, taking over an existing mortgage means that they are responsible for making the mortgage payments on time in order to avoid default and potential foreclosure. Additionally, the original owner could still be held liable for the mortgage if the buyer defaults on the payments.</p>

<p>For the seller, there is a risk that the buyer may default on the mortgage payments, which could result in a foreclosure and damage to the seller's credit. Additionally, the original owner may still be liable for the mortgage even after the property has been sold, which could impact their ability to obtain new financing in the future.</p>

<p>It's important for both parties to carefully consider the potential risks and benefits of a subject-to mortgage before entering into an agreement. It's also important to work with experienced professionals, such as real estate investors, attorneys, and mortgage brokers, who can help guide the process and ensure that all legal and financial obligations are properly addressed.</p>

<p>Subject-to mortgages can be a viable financing option for buyers and sellers alike, but they do come with certain risks and complexities. As with any real estate transaction, it's important to do your due diligence and work with experienced professionals to ensure that the transaction is properly structured and all parties are protected.</p>
