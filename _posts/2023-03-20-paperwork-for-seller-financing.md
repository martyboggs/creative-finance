title: Paperwork for Seller Financing
---
Seller financing can be an attractive option for buyers who have difficulty qualifying for a traditional mortgage and for sellers who want to sell their property quickly and easily. However, like any real estate transaction, there are legal and financial documents that need to be completed to ensure that the sale is legal and binding. In this blog post, we will discuss the paperwork used for seller financing.

## Purchase Agreement
The purchase agreement is a legal contract between the buyer and seller that outlines the terms and conditions of the sale. It should include the purchase price, payment terms, interest rate, default provisions, and any contingencies or warranties. Both parties must sign the purchase agreement to make the sale legally binding.

## Promissory Note
The promissory note is a legal document that details the terms of the loan, including the loan amount, interest rate, payment schedule, and any late fees or penalties. It also specifies the collateral, which in this case is the property being sold. The note is signed by the buyer and is a promise to repay the loan according to the terms outlined in the note.

## Mortgage or Deed of Trust
The mortgage or deed of trust is a legal document that secures the loan with the property being sold as collateral. The document gives the seller the right to foreclose on the property if the buyer fails to make the agreed-upon payments. The document is recorded with the local county recorder's office and provides notice to the public that there is a lien on the property.

## Disclosure Forms
Various disclosure forms are required in real estate transactions to protect both the buyer and seller. These forms may include a property disclosure form, which outlines any known defects or issues with the property, and a lead-based paint disclosure, which is required for homes built before 1978.

## Closing Documents
Finally, there are a variety of closing documents that must be completed and signed by both parties. These may include a settlement statement, which outlines the final costs and fees associated with the sale, and a warranty deed, which transfers ownership of the property from the seller to the buyer.

Seller financing can be a beneficial option for both buyers and sellers, but it's important to ensure that all necessary paperwork is completed correctly to protect both parties. Working with a real estate attorney or title company can help ensure that all legal requirements are met and that the sale proceeds smoothly.
